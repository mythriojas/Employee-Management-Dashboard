  - Create a new cluster at [MongoDB Cluster](https://bit.ly/3zrWsfN)
  - Go to cluster click on connect and follow the steps.
  - Create a user of this collection and remember username and pwd.
  - You should allow IP access from everywhere.
  - Choose connect your application and copy URI and use It in server deployment step.
  - Change URI values with your pwd and username.
- <b>Deploy Server.</b>
  - create a new app on [heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app).
  - Install heroku CLI locally.
  - Open cmd at root of the project.
  - Init heroku repository with `heroku git:remote -a YOUR_APP_NAME`
  - Open `server/app/app.module.ts` and change mongoDB URI to your mongoDB atlas URI.
  - Run `yarn build:server`
  - Now push to heroku master `git push heroku <branch_name>:master`
  - Your server is running at the `APP_URL/graphql`
  - Copy app url It will be needed in client deployment.
- <b>Deploy Client</b>
  - Upload or Clone this repository to github
  - Open `client/src/index.js`
  - Change ApolloClient to `projectData.graphqlServerLive`
  - Go to `projectData` file and replace the value of `graphqlServerLive` with your live GraphQL server URI which you have copied in server deployment.
  - Git push to repository.
  - Use deploy on netlify button at very bottom of this file.
  - You can deploy any branch I will prefer deploying master as It have production ready code.
  - leave the netlify variables empty don't put anything.
  - This project already have a netlify config file, netlify will use this file.

> Happy deploying 😄

### Notes

- if husky hooks not working it can be because of husky didn't created hooks in `.husky` directory. To fix this run the following commands in root of this project.

```json
yarn add -D husky

npm set-script prepare "husky install" && yarn prepare // don't worry if this not work It just add prepare script to npm Scripts which is already added.

npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "yarn lint-staged"

git commit -m "added husky and lint-stagged" // here you will notice the lint-staged checking the files with help of husky
```

- <b>Client</b> application will run at port 3000 if available otherwise it will pick any available port.
- <b>Server</b> will be running at port 4000. <b>GraphQL</b> playground is available at `URL:4000/graphql`
- Server usages default mongoDB port which is `27017`, check `server/src/app/app.module.ts` for details.
